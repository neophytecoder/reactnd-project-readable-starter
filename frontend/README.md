# Readable Frontend (ReactJS)

This is the frontend of <b>Readable</b>. This project is built entirely with an awesome javascript library, namely ReactJS :). For the frontend, I use HTML, CSS, and bootstrap.

## Implementation
To build the project, I followed awesome React design patterns:
1. Composition
2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZg8wg39QQ">High order component</a>
3. Thunk middleware
